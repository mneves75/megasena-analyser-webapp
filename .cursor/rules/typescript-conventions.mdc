## TypeScript Conventions

- Strict TypeScript. Exported APIs must have explicit return types.
- Naming:
  - `PascalCase` for components
  - `camelCase` for utilities
  - Kebab-case for file names (for example, `budget-panel.tsx`)
- Indentation: two spaces.
- Reference shared tokens/constants instead of hard-coded values; centralize in `lib/constants.ts`.
- Align with existing patterns; do not introduce new abstractions unless explicitly requested.
- Match existing formatting; prefer multi-line for readability over dense one-liners.
- Avoid unsafe casts and `any`. Prefer precise types.
