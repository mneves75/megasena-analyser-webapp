## Formatting and Code Citation Rules

- Prefer concise, skimmable communication with headings and bullet points. Use `###`/`##` headings, never `#`.
- Use backticks for file, directory, class, and function names (for example, `app/components/Card.tsx`).
- When citing existing code, use CODE REFERENCES with exact syntax:

```12:34:path/to/file.ext
// code here
```

- Required elements in a code reference: startLine, endLine, and filepath. Do not add language tags or any other metadata to code references.
- Include at least one line of code in any reference block; never leave it empty.
- You may truncate long sections with comments like `// ... more code ...` inside the reference for clarity.
- For new or proposed code not in the repo, use standard fenced code blocks with a language tag (for example, ```ts, ```python, ```bash).
- Never mix formats. Do not add language tags to CODE REFERENCES. Do not add line numbers inside code content.
- Never indent the opening/closing triple backticks.
- Preserve existing indentation style and width in all edits; do not convert tabs/spaces.
