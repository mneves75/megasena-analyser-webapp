## Project Structure Guide

- `app/`: Next.js App Router routes (start with `app/dashboard/page.tsx`).
- `components/`: Reusable UI using Tailwind tokens and shadcn variants.
- `lib/`:
  - `lib/analytics/`: Analytics logic
  - `lib/api/`: Caixa API helpers
  - `lib/constants.ts`: Shared constants and design tokens
- `sqlite/`: SQL migrations (`sqlite/migrations`) and generated types (`sqlite/types`).
- `scripts/`: Bun CLIs like `scripts/pull-draws.ts` for ingest/seeding.
- `tests/`: Vitest (`tests/lib`) and Playwright (`tests/app`) with MSW mocks in `tests/mocks`.
- `docs/`: Product prompts. Update when feature scope shifts:
  - [docs/PROMPT_UI.md](mdc:docs/PROMPT_UI.md)
  - [docs/PROMPT-MAIN.md](mdc:docs/PROMPT-MAIN.md)
  - [docs/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md](mdc:docs/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md)

Constraints:
- Keep changes minimal and targeted to explicitly requested areas.
- Place new Cursor rules under `.cursor/rules` with `.mdc` extension.
- Prefer absolute paths rooted at the workspace when invoking tools.
- Always attach @docs/SYSTEM_PROMPT.md to every chat.
